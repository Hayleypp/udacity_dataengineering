### Project Overview

Sparkify, a music streaming company has decided to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data `ETL pipline.To achieve this, Apache Airflow would be a tool. Tasks consist of creating operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step. Data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazone Redshift. The datasets are JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.
